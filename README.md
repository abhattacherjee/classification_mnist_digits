# Classification of MNIST Dataset
These Jupyter Notebooks are based on chapter 3 of "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow"
by Aurelien Geron

There are 2 notebooks
1. classification_mnist_digits - covers the steps covered in the chapter for binary classification, multiclass classification,
and error analysis
2. mnist_dataset_classifier_knn - creates a new model based on K-Neighbors classifier to improve the accuracy on the test
set to > 97%, and using GridSearch cross-validation to find the best parameters (GridSearchCV on KNN takes several hours
to train)
